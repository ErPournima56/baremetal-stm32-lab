#  Bare-metal vs RTOS
When working with STM32 microcontrollers, developers often face a fundamental decision early in the project: Bare-metal or RTOS?
Both approaches have distinct trade-offs and are suited for different use cases. Here's a practical comparison to help understand which fits your needs — especially if you're just starting out or working on performance-critical systems.


| **Feature / Aspect**     | **Bare-metal**                                                                                                      | **RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)**                                                                                      |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Definition**           | Runs directly on the hardware without any operating system.                                                         | An OS designed for real-time embedded applications, providing multitasking via scheduling.                                 |
| **Architecture**         | Typically structured around a single `main()` loop. Developers manage all events, peripherals, and timing manually. | Built around a **kernel** that manages tasks/threads with priorities and scheduling policies.                              |
| **Task Management**      | Tasks are handled sequentially, often through **state machines** and interrupt routines.                            | Tasks (threads) are independently managed and can run in **parallel**, enabling true **multitasking**.                     |
| **Development Time**     | Quicker to get started with for small/simple applications. Minimal setup.                                           | Faster for scaling complex projects. RTOS offers **modularization** and built-in services like semaphores, queues, timers. |
| **Use Cases**            | Ideal for simple tasks: blinking LEDs, reading sensors, basic control logic.                                        | Best for systems needing concurrency: IoT hubs, GUIs, industrial control, audio processing, robotics.                      |
| **Timing / Determinism** | Highly deterministic in small systems; you control everything.                                                      | Real-time behavior is possible but depends on task design, scheduling strategy, and configuration.                         |


# Why I'm Choosing Bare-Metal (For Now)
In this project, I’m starting bare-metal. Why?

It’s important to understand the hardware and peripheral registers deeply before introducing abstractions.
Great for learning how timers, interrupts, GPIO, and memory-mapped I/O work.
Keeps overhead minimal — critical when every byte and microsecond counts.
Eventually, I may move to an RTOS like FreeRTOS once the system grows in complexity. But for initial bring-up, tight control, and low resource usage, bare-metal makes sense.

I'll be documenting the journey — from setting up the STM32 toolchain, writing peripheral drivers from scratch, to building reusable modules — all without an RTOS (yet).

Stay tuned
